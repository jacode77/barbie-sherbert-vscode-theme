# Barbie Sherbet ðŸ¦©

A Visual Studio Code theme inspired by the colourful world of Barbie. The colour theme default is set to dark mode to remain kind to the eyes, while taking advantage of a range of fun and bright colours typically associated with the Barbie colour palate. As a result of this, the colours have not taken into consideration accessibility and therefore may pose some colour contrast issues for some.

## Inspiration

After hearing about and seeing the various VS Code themes, I wanted to challenge myself to try and create one myself. I anticipated this would help familiarise myself more with using Node while having some fun along the way. The decision to adopt a Barbie colour theme simply came from the idea of creating something bright and energetic for the user to interact with while coding.

While I don't feel the journey has developed any further skills with Node, it has been fun and given me more to think about in the sense of accessibility and some of the consideration some creators put into practice, the [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme perhaps being one of the best examples I came across.

**Enjoy!**
